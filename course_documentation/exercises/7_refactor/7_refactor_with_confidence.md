# Refactor with confidence

You and your team come across an old function in a module named `important_code.py`. Apparently this function is crucial to the application, but it has become difficult to understand and maintain. The author has moved on to another team and is also on vacation. You decide to figure out what the function does and refactor it to improve its readability and maintainability.

To do this, you first create a test file named `test_important_code.py`. You understand that the function takes in a number and returns an integer, but what exactly it does is not clear. Use the test to probe the function's behavior and extend the test to cover a few more cases.

Can you find out what the function is supposed to do?

When you have found the intended behavior, refactor the function to be more readable and efficient, but still pass the test cases you have written.
